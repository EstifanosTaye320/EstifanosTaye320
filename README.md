👋 Hi, I’m @EstifanosTaye320
👀 I’m interested in backend development, frontend development, machine learning, and game development. I'm also fascinated by exploring new technologies and building impactful software.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced backend architecture, react.js/next.js, and exploring more in-depth machine learning concepts.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving backend development with Node.js, Python or Go, and distributed systems. I'm also interested in contributing to projects with a focus on practical applications of machine learning.

⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy creating games in my free time using Python and Pygame, and I have a particular fondness for trying to implement complex ideas using very few lines of code.
